Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models specifically designed for processing structured grid data, such as images. They are widely used in image recognition, object detection, video analysis, and more.
Advantages of CNNs:

Efficient in handling high-dimensional data like images.
Automatically learns spatial hierarchies of features.
Reduces the number of parameters compared to fully connected networks
CodeStructure
Hereâ€™s a structured version of what the code might look like:

Import Libraries

Load and Normalize Data,
Visualize Sample Images,
Build the CNN Model,
Compile the Model,
Train the Model,
Evaluate the Model.
